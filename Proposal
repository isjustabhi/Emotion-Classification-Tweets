# Modeling Experiment Proposal: Emotion Classification from Tweets

## Topic

For this project, I am building a machine learning model that predicts the **emotion expressed in a tweet**. Iâ€™m using the [`mteb/emotion`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/emotion) dataset from Hugging Face, which includes short English tweets labeled with one of six emotions: **joy**, **sadness**, **anger**, **fear**, **love**, and **surprise**.

This project focuses on a traditional NLP approach using:
- **TF-IDF** feature extraction
- A **Logistic Regression** classifier
- Evaluation via accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

## How This Project Differs from Existing Work

While most recent emotion classification projects use large transformer models (like BERT or RoBERTa), this modeling experiment uses a **lightweight, interpretable pipeline**. The emphasis is on:
- Simplicity and reproducibility (no GPU needed)
- Classical machine learning techniques
- Exploring how well simple models perform on emotional text data

This baseline model could also serve as a reference point for future experiments using deep learning or multilingual emotion detection.
