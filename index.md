# Emotion Classification in Tweets ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to my NLP modeling project for detecting **emotions in tweets** using a classical machine learning pipeline.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

This project explores how we can classify emotional tone in tweets using traditional NLP methods. Instead of using large language models, the goal here is to apply lightweight and interpretable techniques like:

- TF-IDF vectorization  
- Logistic Regression  
- Standard text preprocessing

The dataset used is from Hugging Face: [`mteb/emotion`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mteb/emotion), which contains tweets labeled with six emotions:
**joy**, **sadness**, **anger**, **fear**, **love**, and **surprise**.

## ðŸ§ª Modeling Objectives

- Clean and preprocess tweet text  
- Train a classifier to detect emotions  
- Evaluate with accuracy, F1 score, and a confusion matrix  
- Visualize emotion distribution and model performance
